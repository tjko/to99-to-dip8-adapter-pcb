TO-99 to DIP-8 adapter PCB

This is collection of adapters for mounting components in TO-99 package into DIP-8 socket.

This was created to be able to use AD584LH (that is only available in TO-99 package) in place of AD584JN or AD584KN, as AD584LH is higher precision voltage reference and is often being sold for significantly less.

## PCB designs
There is two versions of the PCB:
* Version 1: [KiCad project](/to99-to-pdip8-adapter-v1/)
  ![Version 1 PCB](/images/to99-to-pdip8-v1.png)
* Version 2: [KiCad project](/to99-to-pdip8-adapter-v2/)
  ![Version 2 PCB](/images/to99-to-pdip8-v2.png)


## Kebers

Ready made kerber files of these two PCBs are found under kerbers/ directory.
These ZIP files are ready to be uploaded to a PCB manufacturer website (such as JLCPCB).
